The development was funded mainly by the Poland's National
Science Centre (NCN, [3]).

The development team consists of (in alphabetic order):

    (core code, library design, OOP-formulae concepts [4], 
    concurrency, gnuplot output)

    (shallow-water systems, OOP-formulae concepts [4])
  Anna Jaruga 
    (core code, non-oscillatory option, pressure solvers, 
    automatic tests, OOP-formulae concepts [4], documentation [5])
  Hanna Pawłowska 
    (team management)
  Piotr Smolarkiewicz (the author of MPDATA)
    (consultancy, numerics, documentation [5])
  Maciej Waruszewski 
    (core code, extension to 3D, diffusion terms, 
    non-carthesian geometry, performance optimisations, 
    3D visualisation, open & rigid boundary conditions,
    HDF5/XDMF output)
