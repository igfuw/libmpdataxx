The development was funded mainly by the Poland's National
Science Centre (NCN, [3]).

The development team consists of (in alphabetic order):

    (shallow-water systems, OOP-formulae concepts [4])
  Anna Jaruga 
    (core code, non-oscillatory option, pressure solvers, 
    automatic tests, OOP-formulae concepts [4], documentation [5])
  Hanna Paw≈Çowska 
    (team management)
  Piotr Smolarkiewicz (the author of MPDATA)
    (consultancy, numerics, documentation [5])
  Maciej Waruszewski
